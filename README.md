# AlphaRelativeClauseDetector

This is the repo for our newly developed tool that automatically detects and extracts relative clauses in English.

See the article below for a detailed description of the tool. 

***

We provide two versions of the tool for relative clause detection. 

1. Our Python codes. If you are familiar and comfortable with Python coding, you could find the Python codes in the repo.

2. Our app: Alpha Relative Clause Detector. If you like a User Interface (UI) based app, please download our app in the Releases section of this repo. We provide our app for both MS Windows and Mac OS users.
